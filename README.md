This is a VR research project (Night at the Museum) for the VR Developer Nanodegree course. The project was developed based on research findings including various VR applications in education including schools, universities and professional industries such as construction and public services.

The project Night at the Museum provides a unique immersive exploring experience by combining the traditional “museum exhibition” with “a floating fantasy” traveling experience. Through the VR experience, the player is encouraged to move around and learn how VR can be applied to improve the education process. It could help the users better understand that VR can be effective in learning and increase knowledge retention for students.
